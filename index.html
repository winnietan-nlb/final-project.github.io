	<h1>A Digital Exhibit of Contemporary Southeast Asian Art</h1>
	<p>Contemporary Southeast Asian art often comes under the lens of a hard to miss binary: the east and the west. Discover how Southeast Asian artists have developed new means of expression influenced by their exposure to Western art forms, while balancing their own national heritage and morals. In this mini exhibit, explore contemporary art from the region, especially from Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippine.
